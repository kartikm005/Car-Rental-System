🚗 Car Rental System in Java 🚗


🔍 Project Overview
The Car Rental System includes these key features:
Adding Cars: Each car has a unique ID, brand, model, and a daily rental rate.
Customer Management: Customers are registered automatically during their first rental.
Rental Processing: The system checks car availability, calculates total rental cost, and processes rental requests.
Return Handling: Cars are marked as available once returned.


💡 Code Highlights
Car Class: Manages car details and availability status.
Customer Class: Holds customer information like ID and name.
Rental Class: Links a car and customer to track the rental period.
CarRentalSystem Class: Acts as the main controller, managing car rentals, returns, and user interaction.


👨‍💻 Code Demo
The main menu lets users rent or return a car. When renting, the system shows available cars, registers the user, calculates the total cost, and prompts for confirmation. On returning, it verifies the car ID and updates availability.

This project has been a great exercise in handling objects, lists, and basic user interaction in Java!
